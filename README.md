JQuery programming code

## Introduction

JQuery, is very good for...  

- When you want to toggle opening and closing a certain section of a web page.  

Example...  

- UL/OL lists  
- Paragraphs  
- and, so on...  

...in effect, this makes the web page appear to be much shorter than it actually is;  
because, not all content is fully expanded; also, users can select to expand select parts of the page;  
so, if a page has 4 sections; you could expand only sections 1 and 4...whilst leaving sections 2/3 shut.  

It is also used for many other purposes, too...  

- click 
- mouseover  
- etc.
