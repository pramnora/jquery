JQuery programming code

## Introduction

JQuery, is very good for...  

- When you want to toggle opening and closing a certain section of a web page.  

Example...  

- UL/OL lists  
- Paragraphs  
- and, so on...  

...in effect, this makes the web page appear to be much shorter than it actually is;  
because, not all content is fully expanded; also, users can opt to expand only select parts of the page;  
so, if a page has 4 sections; you could expand only sections 1 and 4...whilst leaving sections 2/3 shut.  

It is also used for many other purposes, too...  

- click 
- mouseover  
- etc.  

Generally speaking, you can use JQuery code...; to make your web pages very highly 'interactive';    
whilst at the same time using 'minimal' Javascript code.  
(Otherwise, the Javascript code would have been written a whole lot longer, instead;  
 so, it serves as a 'short cut' way of doing things...as opposed to the standard way of using Javascript.)
